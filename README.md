## Admin panel & saving for all users

- **Admin URL:** `/admin` — sign in with **brijeshparjapat52@gmail.com** (no password).
- **Save button:** In the admin header, click **Save changes**. This always saves to your browser (localStorage). To have the same config for **all users** (any device, any browser), use Supabase below.

### Supabase: one config for everyone

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL Editor, run the script in **`supabase-setup.sql`** (creates `site_config` table).
3. In your project root, create a **`.env`** file:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```
   (Find both in Supabase: Project Settings → API.)
4. Restart dev server or rebuild: `npm run dev` / `npm run build`.

After this, when you click **Save changes** in admin, config is stored in Supabase. Every visitor loads that config when they open the site, so they see the same content and theme.
